Synopsis
--------

The Python 3.6+ module ``mcst`` provides a polynomial-time algorithm to compute
optimally pruned Markov chain scenario trees, which can for instance be used in
Nonlinear Model Predictive Control applications under uncertainty. Moreover, it
provides a convenient method for the visualization of scenario trees.
